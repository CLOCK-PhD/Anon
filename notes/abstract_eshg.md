## Premier draft


**Introduction:**

With the remarkable advancements in sequencing techniques and the significant reduction in their costs, the field of genomics has experienced an unprecedented increase in the volume of genomic data available for research purposes. This surge in genomic data holds immense potential for enhancing our understanding of complex diseases, advancing personalized medicine, and fostering innovations in health care. In this goal, several countries launched and developped genomic data collection programs, and companies offering Direct-to-Consumer (DtC) genetic testing (Anecestry, 23andMe) lead to people sharing their genomic data online (Personal Genome Project). However, it simultaneously poses substantial privacy risks, as the highly sensitive nature of genomic information could lead to re-identification or potential misuse if not adequately protected. The balance between leveraging genomic data for scientific advancement and safeguarding individual privacy is a critical concern in the bioinformatics community. Despite the importance of data sharing for fostering research and advancements in genomics, there is a pressing need to develop novel approaches that mitigate privacy risks while preserving the utility of the data for research. This study aims to address this crucial issue by exploring innovative methods that minimize privacy vulnerabilities in genomic data sharing without hindering the accessibility and processing of the data for scientific discovery. Our focus diverges from traditional data access and protection strategies, offering a fresh perspective on ensuring genome privacy in the context of open scientific research.


**Methods:**

Here, we propose a novel approach based on k-mers to estimate the re-identification risks associated with genomic data sharing. Our methodology leverages a k-mer matrix generated by the program iMoka previously developped by our team: a tool that allows for the prediction of genetic diseases by identifying a collection of signature k-mers indicative of specific conditions. The utilization of a k-mer matrix inherently reduces the risk of re-identification by circumventing the privacy vulnerabilities posed by repetitive regions, such as transposable elements or Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), which are traditionally used to identify an individual.

To systematically assess the re-identification risks, we focus on evaluating the privacy implications of sharing k-mer matrices. Given that k-mers are short DNA sequences (typically 31 bases in length, may vary), the primary risk of re-identification emanates from Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) present within these k-mers. SNPs, being the most common type of genetic variation among people, serve as identifiers. A combination of a small number of them is sufficient to uniquely identify someone and are used in population genomics, DtC genetic testing, or forensic genetics.

Our analysis begins with the detection of SNPs within the k-mers, utilizing publicly available databases such as dbSNP. This step is crucial for identifying which k-mers contain variations that could contribute to re-identification risk. Following SNP identification, we estimate the probability of individual identity by analyzing the frequency and distribution of these SNPs. Our goal in this process is the establishment of a risk score: a quantitative measure reflecting the likelihood of re-identification from shared k-mer matrices.

**Expected Results:**

Through our k-mer based approach, we anticipate developing a comprehensive risk score that will enable researchers to quantitatively assess the re-identification risks associated with sharing genomic data in the form of k-mer matrices. This score is expected to provide a critical tool for making informed decisions about data sharing, balancing the need for privacy with the imperative of advancing genomic research. We hypothesize that our findings will demonstrate that using k-mer matrices significantly lowers the risk of re-identification compared to traditional methods of genomic data sharing, without compromising the ability to accurately predict genetic diseases. The validation of our approach would mark a significant advancement in the field, offering a pragmatic solution to the privacy concerns that hinder the sharing of genomic data.

**Conclusion:**

The proposed study addresses a crucial gap in the field of genomics by providing a method to estimate and mitigate the risks of re-identification inherent in the sharing of genomic data. By focusing on the utility of k-mer matrices and the development of a novel risk score, our work aims to facilitate safer data sharing practices that do not compromise the integrity and utility of genomic information. The anticipated results promise not only to enhance the privacy and security of genomic data but also to sustain the momentum of genomic research by ensuring that data sharing remains a viable and valuable practice. Moving forward, the next phase of our research will involve leveraging the detected SNPs within the k-mer matrices to further assess re-identification risks. We plan to explore additional methods, such as inference or imputation techniques using established tools like IMPUTE2, to refine our risk assessment and continue to advance the field towards secure and effective genomic data sharing.
